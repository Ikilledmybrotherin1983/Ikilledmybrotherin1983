Hi ! My name is Michael / Daisuke. I don't really plan on being active as this is more for my ponytown account.


Copying or Taking inspo? Please do not copy or take inspo from my ponies unless I give permission.


C+H/C+H+K? [Cuddle + Hug, Cuddle, Hug and Kiss.] I am uncomfortable with all of the above unless we are friends. 


Roleplay, And Interacting? Roleplay usually depends on my mood but is welcome if I have "Roleplay ✓" in my name, otherwise please refrain from it as it stresses me out and makes me uncomfortable. Interacting? Absolutely! I love when others talk to me or sit with me, So don't be shy!.


Quick DNI. Toxic people, Basic dni criteria, Reality checkers — I am aware I am not a a fictional character in real life and do seperate it from my personal life. So attempting to reality check doesn't really do anything. Anyone under 14 for obvious reasons as I make more mature jokes around my friends and prefer people in my age range. 18+ unless I know you, And also Any Aftons that will harass and try to force me into their family or roleplay. I already have my family so please don't.
